# Password Manager in C++

## Description
This is a console-based password manager created for educational purposes to practice and improve my C++ skills. The application allows users to securely store and manage their passwords in a simple text-based interface.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: Core programming language for the application.
- **SQL (Planned for Future Enhancements)**: Database integration for persistent password storage.
- **File I/O**: Storing passwords temporarily in local files for now.

## Features
- **Add Password**: Users can add passwords, including a website name, username, and password.
- **View Passwords**: Display stored passwords (basic implementation without encryption for now).
- **Exit Gracefully**: Allows users to exit the program safely.

## How to Build and Run
1. Clone the repository:  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DevAniela/PasswordManager.git
   ```
2. Open the project in an IDE (e.g., Code::Blocks).
3. Build the project.
4. Run the project from your IDE's console.

## Usage
